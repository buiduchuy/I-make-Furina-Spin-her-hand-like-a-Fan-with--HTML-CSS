</h2> Hi guys, this is a first thing I uploaded on my way to learning how to make a web</h2>
this just a stoooopid thing that I made when I'm free and you know, it's not be perfect as I thought because the space between the Fan with a character need to using a margin , It's not consistent with another devices

HTML: Hyper Text MakeUp Language
Look like I thought, this's not an programer language. In my view, It's a tool for presented a web element inside it
It's not hard as you thought, it's not stricted like another language

CSS: cascading style sheet
Yeah, it's simple like a make up when going out for presentation, the website presented without css kinna weird and it's like a website that has been in the past for a long time, the people nowaday wanna a pretty website for their own and they can customized the website like their imagine

JS: Yes, that's the hardest thing about creating a website, it's respectful kinna that you can enjoy that, which stumbles me a lot. BTW If you can enjoy the fun of coding, you can get over it

I've heard of some frameworks like bootstrap, django, reactJS,... Kinna is useful, but you need to know about HTML and CSS before learning them, because it's just a tool that makes your coding easier, you have to know that you're in control of them, don't make them control you
